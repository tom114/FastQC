Compiling FastQC JAR for IRIDA
==============================

Run the `build-irida.sh` script from the project root directory.  This will create `.jar` and `.pom` files within the `irida/` subdirectory.  These files can be copied to the irida `lib/` directory.  IRIDA's `install-libs.sh` script will need to be updated to reflect the new jar versions.`
